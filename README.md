# Simple Profile Creation Application

This is a simple application that allows users to create a profile locally.

## Architecture
The app follows the MVI (Model-View-Intent) architecture, ensuring a unidirectional and cyclical data flow.

## Technologies Used
- **XML**: For defining UI layouts in a structured format.
- **Flow**: For asynchronous stream processing and state management.
- **Retrofit**: For handling network requests in a type-safe manner.
- **Navigation Graphs**: To manage app navigation and simplify the implementation of transitions between screens.
- **Camera 2 API**: For accessing and controlling camera hardware features, allowing users to take pictures for their profile.
